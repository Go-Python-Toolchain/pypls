"""Run a command once and print its wall time and peak resident memory.

GNU time reports elapsed wall to only 10 ms, which rounds pypls's few-
millisecond check down to zero. This wrapper uses perf_counter for microsecond
wall resolution and getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN).ru_maxrss for the child's peak
resident set size, so a single process launch yields both numbers accurately.

Output (one line, to stdout):  <wall_seconds>,<max_rss_kb>,<exit_code>
The measured command's own stdout and stderr are discarded.
